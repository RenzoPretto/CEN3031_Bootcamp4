 * From flawfinder man page:

 * "Level" is the risk level (0-5, 5 is riskiest), "Category" is the general flawfinder category,
 * "Name" is the name of the triggering rule, "Warning" is text explaining why it is a hit (finding),
 * "Suggestion" is text suggesting how it might be fixed, "Note" is other explanatory notes,
 * "CWEs" is the list of one or more CWEs,
 * "Context" is the source code line triggering the hit,
 * and "Fingerprint" is the SHA-256 hash of the context once its leading and trailing whitespace have
 * been removed (the fingerprint may help detect and eliminate later duplications). If you use Python3,
 * the hash is of the context when encoded as UTF-8.
