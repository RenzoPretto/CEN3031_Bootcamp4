# flawCatcher

Currently works on intel Macs and M1 with Rosetta, as well as Windows 10.

Currently developers shoudl use Intellij if possible.

To build the exe on windows, must install Wix https://wixtoolset.org/releases/

Once downloaded, unzip the installer and run it to  install Wix to the system.

Two run configurations:

1) Run the project in Intellij (FlawCatcherApplication)
2) Create Bundle to build the installable package
